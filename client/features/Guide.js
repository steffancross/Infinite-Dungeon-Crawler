        <h1>Unconstrained by rules or objectives, only adventure!</h1>
        <h3>Actions</h3>
        <p>
          You decide what your character says or does. The AI will produce the
          scenario, other characters, and world events for you to respond to.
          Every adventure is unique and free flowing.
        </p>
        <h3>Chatbox</h3>
        <p>
          Specific prompts with a single action or phrase result in the best
          experience. Try to be concise but include all the information you want
          to get across.
        </p>
        <h3>Imagination</h3>
        <p>
          You are the navigator of your story, take it wherever you see fit. You
          can do and say almost anything and the AI will respond in turn. Of
          course there may be some quirks but part of the adventure can be
          pushing the boundaries as well. Lastly, have fun and explore your
          imagination!
